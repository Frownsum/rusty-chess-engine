## Chess Engine

In this project I will be working to create a chess engine that 
interacts with the UCI (universal chess interface)
so that it can be played against by a human player.

### Inspiration

I saw the video from suckerpinch 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXy041BIlA&t=422s) 
and thought it seemed like an interesting exercise.

### Progress notes

I decided to use cutechess for the GUI for now. Maybe I'll make my own later,
but it seemed like a good way to start and compiled easily.

### Goals

* [ ] Write code that can submit 1 a4 ... 2 a2 to a UCI compatible GUI.
* [ ] Write a random move chess engine.
* [ ] Write a chess engine that only strives to naively get to a good scoring position
* [ ] Use the score evaluation to write minimax
* [ ] Write alpha beta pruning
* [ ] Abstract the parts written for the previous suggestions to allow for more easily writing custom scoring functions
* [ ] Write an extra couple strategies
* [ ] benchmark parts for speed?
* [ ] more if I still find this interesting to work on.
